# Fetching and displaying geo-referenced collision data (2006â€“2021) on a Mapbox GL JS web map.
# Generating a bounding box from the collision point data using Turf.js.
# Using the bounding box to create a hexgrid (hexagonal polygons) with Turf.js.
# Aggregating collision counts within each hexagon via the turf.collect() function.
# Visualizing the hexgrid with color-coding based on collision counts.
# Adding pop-ups to show collision counts.
# Creating a legend to explain the color gradient to users.
